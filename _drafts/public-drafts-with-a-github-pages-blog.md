I wrote [last week]({% post_url 2017-01-06-using-workflow-to-publish-to-github-pages %}) about publishing to a GitHub Pages blog using [Workflow](https://workflow.is) on the iPad. As I worked on writing that post, I realized there was one piece missing from my process: previewing the draft. When I write locally on my computer, I compile the site using the [Jekyll commands](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) and include drafts. Then I can work on a post and see how it is coming, and make sure that the links all work properly and do a final check before publishing the post. With the process I had before, a post would go straight from iA Writer to published on my site, and that made me a bit nervous.

## Displaying drafts
- Use collection
- Default layout
- Make index page

## Add workflows
