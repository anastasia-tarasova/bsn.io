I️ think that all humans are physic to some degree or other. As a strange mix of emotion and logic, there are natural tensions that operate on us. We are wired to notice the new or unusual, and this has a real impact on our ability to focus on a task or project for an extended length of time. I️ have found that to be extremely true in myself. I️ will get excited about a new project and dive in with great passion. But after the novelty wears off, and I️ am distracted by something new, it is far too easy to let go of previous projects.

This has certainly been true with my blogging. I️ will go in phases where I️ am diligent about writing, and find it extremely beneficial. But, inevitably, new things come up. For me, those typically come in the form of new apps that I️ want to build. It is a real challenge to maintain consistency with a naturally long-term task like blogging.

At different times in my life, I️ have tried to fight this tendency with varying levels of success. There are certainly long-term commitments that need to not fade from priority or lose attention. Some of the most important for me are my wife and six kids.
