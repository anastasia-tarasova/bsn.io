This is a library I made in order to prompt for user feedback or App Store reviews in a pleasant, non-obtrusive way. It is designed to drop down a view with a question and two answers. The typical flow would be to ask whether the user is having a good experience, and if so, ask for a review, and if not, ask for email feedback.
