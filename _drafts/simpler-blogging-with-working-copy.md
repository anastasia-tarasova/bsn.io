I have [written](% post_url 2017-01-06-using-workflow-to-publish-to-github-pages %) [before]({% post_url 2017-01-12-public-drafts-with-a-github-pages-blog %}) about my attempts to publish to my GitHub Pages blog from iOS. I have recently started using [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) to make this even easier. Basically, I am trying to remove all of my excuses in the hopes that I will be more diligent in posting to my blog. 

There are three pieces to my new process that I want to explore:

1. Microblog posts
2. New drafts
3. Publishing
