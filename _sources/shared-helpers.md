This has become my dumping ground for all helpful additions and extensions that I want to be able to reuse in all of my apps. Generally, if I find something that I was to share between my apps, and it does not make sense as a library by itself, I include it here.

Some of the highlights include:
- `UIView` subclasses of different varieties to allow for colors and fonts to be set with names in Interface Builder
	- These have the added benefit of being ready to update colors when switching to a dark mode or other theme
- Swipe transition support to allow for card-like dismissal of modal screen
- Keyboard handling logic for adjusting views in response to keyboard changes
